Java Code

Welcome to Basketballs! 

This code reads a .txt file formatted as a double array to figure out the smallest box-type that can fit a basketball inside it.

Some lines at the beginning will contain three numbers separated by spaces representing the width, height,and length of the available size of boxes in the inventory. Note that each of these lines represents a box-type. The rest of the lines will contain only one number in each line to represent the radius of a
basketball.

The word “smallest” refers to a comparison in terms of the volume of the boxes

A sample txt file has been provided

To run this code use any terminal and input the following commands;

javac MainProg.java
java MainProg

When the app asks for a full file name with address location you can either input the full address location or drag file and drop into terminal for auto fill 

Example: /Users/{your-path-to-repo}/basketballs/data.txt
